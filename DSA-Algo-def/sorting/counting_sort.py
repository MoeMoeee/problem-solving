# Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the
# number of occurrences of each unique element in the array.

# Time Complexity
# Best	            O(n+u)  (u is size)
# Worst	            O(n+u)
# Average	        O(n+u)
# Space Complexity	O(n+u) for best, worst, average
# Stability	        Yes
